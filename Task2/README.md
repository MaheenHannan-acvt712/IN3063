Task 2
Directory contains:
1) Dataset Generator written in Python and Jupyter Notebook
2)     Using Torchvision to load the dataset and using NumPy to return a workable NumPy array/dataset
3) Neural Network written in Python and Jupyter Notebook
4)     Written in NumPy - implements Forward and Backward pass with choice for ReLU and Sigmoid in addition to simple loss and prediction methods
5) Network Trainer/Tester written in Python and Jupyter Notebook
6)     Iteratively trains the network then tests it - also collects results for a CSV output
7) Main written in Python and Jupyter Notebook
8)     Executes the project iteratively through various Hidden Layer architectures and activations with specified epochs, prints and exports results.
9) results.csv
10)     Results file from 120 epochs each with 18750 mini-batch steps for ReLU and Sigmoid activations (total file size is 9.5MB and total row count is 225000)
11)       Can be regenerated after main.py execution
